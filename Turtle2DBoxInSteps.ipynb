    "# Bouncing balls in a 2D box\n",

    "Visualization - graphically displaying the results so you can see what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas - think of the air around us.  Simplistically, it is comprised of tiny particles (atoms or molecules) in free motion, occasionally bumping into each other or the walls of the box.\n",

    "Non-interacting - we will ignore the atoms bumping into each other (another turtle code example example illustrates how we can include interactions).  \n",

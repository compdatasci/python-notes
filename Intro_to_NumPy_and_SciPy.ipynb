    "NumPy is similar to Matlab/Octave because it focuses on arrays of data. We will look at how to create NumPy arrays from Python lists as well as some functions for natively creating arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing to know about NumPy arrays is that they are really just dumb collections of numbers which appear together in memory. Their syntax is very similar at a high level to working with lists in Python, where one uses the command a[i-1] to access the ith entry of a list/array `a`.There are a few caveats to NumPy arrays that make them different from other Python data types such as lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every entry in a NumPy array will have the same type. That means that arrays don't mix up Integers with Floats, Strings, or other types.\n",
    "  - In contrast, Python lists can mix different types. This makes them very flexible for general purpose programming but not very good for numerical programming.\n",
    "2. NumPy arrays facilitate numerical computation in a manner similar to Matlab/octave.\n",
    "  - NumPy arrays allow all Python arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`) to act on arrays. By default, these all operate elementwise.\n",
    "  - Matlab arrays have similar operations, but require the special elementwise operators .`*`, `./`, `.^`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to create NumPy arrays is by passing a Python list and creating an array object."
